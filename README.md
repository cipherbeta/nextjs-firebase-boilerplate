# NextJS x Firebase x SCSS boilerplate

A simple, straightforward boilerplate for the above. Uses a Context.Provider interface to allow you to easily reference firebase via hooks. Also includes scss integration, a custom app file, and a custom document file already generated so you can get right to developing.

## How to use

Clone the repository. In a console, type `yarn install` to install necessary dependencies. If you're using npm, delete the `yarn.lock` file before running `npm install`. Type `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev` to start a development server.
